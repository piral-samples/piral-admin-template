# piral-admin-template

A monorepo template for creating an Admin UI with Piral based on [tabler-react](http://tabler-react.com).

Provides a great starting point for building modular (Admin) UI interfaces. Different repositories? Monorepo? Hybrid? You decide.

## Adding a new pilet

Just run

```sh
name=foo yarn add:pilet
```

it will create a new directory *packages/pilet-foo*, already scaffolded and integrated. Choose a different run than **foo** for your purposes.
